                <li>Melt the butter in a small microwaveable ramekin. Tilt the ramekin to coat the sides.</li>
                <li>Crush the graham crackers into fine crumbs, then add to the ramekin with the butter and mix well. With a spoon, press the crust evenly against the bottom of the dish.
                </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla, stirring until there are no lumps.</li>
                <li>Spread the filling on top of the graham cracker crust.
                </li>
                <li>Microwave for at least 4 minutes, 45 seconds at a time, at half power. Make sure the cheesecake does not bubble over the sides of the ramekin.
                </li>
                <li>Chill in the freezer for at least 30 minutes, until completely cool to the touch.
                </li>
                <li>With a knife, loosen the edges of the cheesecake, then invert onto a plate, or eat straight from the dish.
                </li>
                <li>Top with something if you want.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
